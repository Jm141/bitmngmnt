# Dashboard Updates - Finished Goods & Low Stock Statistics

## What Was Added

### New Dashboard Statistics Card: Finished Goods

**Location**: Main Dashboard (Home page)

**Displays**:
- **Total Finished Goods Count**: Number of finished good items in inventory
- **Low Stock Alert**: Shows how many finished goods are below reorder level
- **Visual Indicator**: 
  - Green checkmark if all well stocked
  - Orange warning if any are low stock
- **Icon**: Cookie/bakery icon (green background)

### Enhanced Low Stock Tracking

**What's Tracked**:
1. **Total Low Stock Items**: All items below reorder level (existing)
2. **Finished Goods Low Stock**: Specifically tracks finished goods that are low
3. **Out of Stock**: Items with zero quantity (existing)

### Dashboard Layout

**5 Statistics Cards** (left to right):
1. **Total Items** - All active items
2. **Total Value** - Total inventory value in ₱
3. **Low Stock Items** - Items below reorder level
4. **Out of Stock** - Items with 0 quantity
5. **Finished Goods** - NEW! Finished goods count with low stock indicator

## How It Works

### Finished Goods Tracking
```python
# Counts items where category = 'finished_good'
# Checks if stock <= reorder_level
# Calculates total value of finished goods
```

### Low Stock Detection
- **Low Stock**: `current_stock > 0 AND current_stock <= reorder_level`
- **Out of Stock**: `current_stock = 0`
- **Finished Goods Low**: Same logic but only for finished goods

## Visual Indicators

### Finished Goods Card
- **Green** "All well stocked" - No finished goods are low
- **Orange** "X low stock" - Shows count of low stock finished goods

### Example
If you have:
- 5 finished goods total
- 2 are below reorder level
- Display: "5" (count) + "2 low stock" (warning)
