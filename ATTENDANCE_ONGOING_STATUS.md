# Attendance Ongoing Status - Implemented

## ✅ Feature Added

The attendance system now shows **"Ongoing"** status when a shift has been clocked in but not clocked out!

---

## 🎯 **What Changed**

### **Status Detection Logic**

Previously, attendance had only 3 states:
- ✅ **Complete** - Both AM and PM shifts fully clocked in/out
- ⚠️ **Partial** - One shift complete, one missing
- ❌ **Absent** - No attendance record

Now there's a 4th state:
- 🕐 **Ongoing** - Clocked in but not clocked out yet

---

## 🔍 **Detection Logic**

### **Ongoing Status is True When:**
- AM shift: `time_in_am` exists BUT `time_out_am` is NULL
- OR PM shift: `time_in_pm` exists BUT `time_out_pm` is NULL

### **Priority Order:**
1. **Complete** - Both shifts fully done
2. **Ongoing** - Currently clocked in (takes priority over partial)
3. **Partial** - One shift done, one missing (but not ongoing)
4. **Absent** - No record

---

## 💻 **Code Changes**

### **1. Backend (views.py)**

Updated `attendance_dashboard` view to detect ongoing status:

```python
# Check if ongoing (clocked in but not out)
am_ongoing = record.time_in_am and not record.time_out_am
pm_ongoing = record.time_in_pm and not record.time_out_pm

is_complete = am_complete and pm_complete
is_partial = (am_complete or pm_complete) and not is_complete and not (am_ongoing or pm_ongoing)
is_ongoing = am_ongoing or pm_ongoing
```

### **2. Frontend (attendance_dashboard.html)**

**Calendar Display:**
- Added `is_ongoing` class to calendar days
- Shows clock icon (⏰) for ongoing days
- Blue color scheme

**Legend:**
- Added "Ongoing" to the legend
- Blue indicator box

**CSS:**
- Blue background (#dbeafe)
- Blue border (#2563eb)
- Pulse animation (2s infinite)

---

## 🎨 **Visual Design**

### **Calendar Day Appearance:**

**Ongoing Status:**
- Background: Light blue (#dbeafe)
- Border: Blue (#2563eb)
- Icon: 🕐 Clock (blue)
- Animation: Gentle pulse effect

**Color Scheme:**
- 🟢 **Green** = Complete
- 🔵 **Blue** = Ongoing (NEW!)
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Partial
- ⚪ **Gray** = Absent

---

## 📊 **Status Examples**

### **Example 1: Ongoing AM Shift**
```
AM: Clock In: 8:00 AM, Clock Out: NULL
PM: Clock In: NULL, Clock Out: NULL
Status: ONGOING (blue, pulsing)
```

### **Example 2: Ongoing PM Shift**
```
AM: Clock In: 8:00 AM, Clock Out: 12:00 PM
PM: Clock In: 1:00 PM, Clock Out: NULL
Status: ONGOING (blue, pulsing)
```

### **Example 3: Complete**
```
AM: Clock In: 8:00 AM, Clock Out: 12:00 PM
PM: Clock In: 1:00 PM, Clock Out: 5:00 PM
Status: COMPLETE (green)
```

### **Example 4: Partial (Not Ongoing)**
```
AM: Clock In: 8:00 AM, Clock Out: 12:00 PM
PM: Clock In: NULL, Clock Out: NULL
Status: PARTIAL (yellow)
```

---

## 🔄 **Real-Time Updates**

The ongoing status is **dynamic**:

1. **User clocks in** → Status changes to "Ongoing" (blue, pulsing)
2. **User clocks out** → Status changes to "Complete" (green) or "Partial" (yellow)
3. **Page refresh** → Status updates based on current database state

---

## 💡 **Use Cases**

### **For Staff:**
- See at a glance if they're currently clocked in
- Know if they forgot to clock out
- Visual reminder of ongoing shift

### **For Admins:**
- Monitor who is currently working
- Identify staff who forgot to clock out
- Real-time attendance status

---

## 🎭 **Animation Details**

The ongoing status has a **pulse animation**:

```css
@keyframes pulse {
    0%, 100% {
        opacity: 1;
    }
    50% {
        opacity: 0.7;
    }
}
```

- Duration: 2 seconds
- Effect: Gentle fade in/out
- Purpose: Draw attention to active/ongoing status

---

## 📱 **Responsive**

The ongoing status works on:
- Desktop calendar view
- Mobile calendar view
- Today's attendance card
- Monthly overview
