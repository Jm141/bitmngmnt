# Recipe Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The recipe management system has been updated to allow users to create recipes with:
1. **Recipe Name** (e.g., "Croissant")
2. **Ingredients** with quantities (e.g., flour 500g, butter 250g, sugar 50g, salt 10g)
3. **Preparation Steps** (detailed instructions)
4. **Product Link** (the finished good this recipe produces)

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- **Added `steps` field** to the `Recipe` model to store preparation instructions
- **Migration created**: `0008_add_recipe_steps.py` (already applied)

### 2. Updated Models (`inventory/models.py`)
```python
class Recipe(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    product = models.ForeignKey(Item, ...)  # The finished product
    yield_qty = models.DecimalField(...)     # How much it produces
    yield_unit = models.CharField(...)       # Unit of measurement
    description = models.TextField(...)      # Brief description
    steps = models.TextField(...)            # NEW: Preparation steps
    is_active = models.BooleanField(...)
    # ... other fields
```

### 3. Updated Forms (`inventory/forms.py`)
- **RecipeForm** now includes:
  - `steps` field for preparation instructions
  - `ingredients_data` hidden field to store ingredient JSON data
  - Placeholders and help text for better UX

### 4. Updated Views (`inventory/views.py`)
- **recipe_create** view now:
  - Accepts ingredients data as JSON
  - Automatically creates `RecipeItem` entries for each ingredient
  - Passes all available ingredients to the template for selection

### 5. New/Updated Templates

#### `recipe_form.html` (Create Recipe)
- **Dynamic ingredient management**: Add/remove ingredients with JavaScript
- **Ingredient fields**: Select ingredient, quantity, unit
- **Auto-unit selection**: Automatically selects the ingredient's default unit
- **Validation**: Ensures at least one ingredient is added
- **Steps textarea**: Multi-line input for preparation steps
- **Example shown**: Croissant recipe example in sidebar

#### `recipe_detail.html` (View Recipe) - NEW
- **Recipe Information**: Name, product, yield, status
- **Ingredients Table**: Lists all ingredients with quantities
- **Preparation Steps**: Displays step-by-step instructions
- **Cost Summary**: Shows total cost and cost per unit
- **Quick Stats**: Ingredient count, category, last updated
- **Future Feature Note**: Mentions auto-calculation of ingredient consumption

#### `recipe_list.html` (List Recipes)
- Fixed field names to match model (product, yield_qty, recipe_items)
- Displays recipe cards with key information
- Shows ingredient count and cost per unit

## How to Use

### Creating a Recipe

     Step 6: Bake at 180°C for 20 minutes
     ```

5. **Save**
   - Click "Save Recipe"
   - You'll be redirected to the recipe detail page

### Viewing a Recipe

- Click "View" on any recipe card in the recipe list
- You'll see:
  - Complete recipe information
  - All ingredients with quantities
  - Preparation steps
  - Cost breakdown
  - Quick stats

## Future Feature (Not Yet Implemented)

### Auto-Calculate Ingredient Consumption
When you create a product using a recipe (production), the system will:
1. Calculate required ingredients based on output quantity
2. Automatically deduct ingredients from stock
3. Track ingredient usage per production batch

**Example:**
- Recipe: Croissant (yields 10 pieces)
  - Flour: 500g
  - Butter: 250g
  - Sugar: 50g
  - Salt: 10g

- Production: Make 20 croissants
  - System calculates: 2x the recipe (20 ÷ 10 = 2)
  - Auto-deduct:
    - Flour: 1000g (500g × 2)
    - Butter: 500g (250g × 2)
    - Sugar: 100g (50g × 2)
    - Salt: 20g (10g × 2)

This feature will be implemented in the production workflow.
