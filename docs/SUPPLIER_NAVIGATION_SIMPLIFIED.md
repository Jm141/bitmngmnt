## 🎯 Supplier Navigation (New)

### What Suppliers See:

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│  INVENTRA            │
│  ══════════          │
│                      │
│  🏠 Dashboard        │  ← Supplier Dashboard
│  📋 My Orders        │  ← Supplier Orders Only
│  🚪 Logout           │  ← Logout
│                      │
└──────────────────────┘

That's it! Clean and simple! ✅
```

### What Suppliers DON'T See Anymore:

❌ Inventory  
❌ Items  
❌ Stock Operations  
❌ Purchase Orders (admin view)  
❌ Suppliers  
❌ Recipes  
❌ Reports  
❌ Team  
❌ Settings  

**Only what they need!** ✅

---

## 🎨 Admin/Staff Navigation (Unchanged)

### Staff/Admin Still See Full Menu:

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│  INVENTRA            │
│  ══════════          │
│                      │
│  🏠 Dashboard        │
│  📦 Inventory        │
│  🛍️  Items           │
│  🔄 Stock Operations │
│  🛒 Purchase Orders  │
│  🚚 Suppliers        │
│  📖 Recipes          │
│  📊 Reports          │
│  👥 Team             │
│  📅 Attendance       │
│  📋 Audit Logs       │

└──────────────────────┘
```

**Full access for staff!** ✅

## 📱 Visual Comparison

### Before (Confusing for Suppliers):

```
Supplier logged in, saw:
├─ Dashboard (confusing - which one?)
├─ Inventory (can't access)
├─ Items (can't access)
├─ Stock Operations (can't access)
├─ Purchase Orders (wrong view)
├─ Suppliers (doesn't need)
├─ Recipes (doesn't need)
├─ Reports (can't access)
└─ Settings (can't access)

Result: Confusing! ❌
```

### After (Clean for Suppliers):

```
Supplier logged in, sees:
├─ Dashboard (supplier dashboard)
├─ My Orders (their orders)
└─ Logout (exit)

Result: Perfect! ✅
```

---

## 🎯 What Each Menu Item Does

### For Suppliers:

**🏠 Dashboard**
- Goes to: `/supplier/dashboard/`
- Shows: Statistics, recent orders, quick actions
- Purpose: Overview of all your orders

**📋 My Orders**
- Goes to: `/supplier/orders/`
- Shows: All your orders with filtering
- Purpose: View, approve, and manage orders

**🚪 Logout**
- Action: Logs out
- Returns to: Supplier login page
- Purpose: Secure exit

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Navigation Logic:

```django
{% if user.role == 'supplier' %}
    {# Show supplier menu only #}
    - Dashboard
    - My Orders
    - Logout
{% else %}
    {# Show full staff/admin menu #}
    - All menu items
{% endif %}
```

**Automatic based on user role!** ✅

---

## 🚀 Test the New Navigation

### After Restarting Server:

**On Phone (Supplier Login):**
```
1. Login: test_supplier / supplier123

2. Look at left sidebar (or menu if mobile)

3. Should see ONLY:
   ├─ 🏠 Dashboard
   ├─ 📋 My Orders
   └─ 🚪 Logout

✅ Clean and simple!
```

**On Computer (Admin Login):**
```
1. Login: admin / (your password)

2. Look at left sidebar

3. Should see ALL items:
   ├─ Dashboard
   ├─ Inventory
   ├─ Items
   ├─ Stock Operations
   ├─ Purchase Orders
   └─ ... (all menu items)

✅ Full access for admin!
```
