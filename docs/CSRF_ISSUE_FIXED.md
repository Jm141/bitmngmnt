# ‚úÖ CSRF Error FIXED!

## Error You Got

```
Forbidden (403)
CSRF verification failed. Request aborted.
CSRF cookie not set.
```

---

## üîß What Was Wrong

Django was configured for **HTTPS** (secure connections), but you're accessing from phone over **HTTP**.

**The Problem:**
```python
# Settings were:
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True  ‚Üê Requires HTTPS
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True  ‚Üê Requires HTTPS
```

This means cookies only work over HTTPS, not HTTP!

---

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed

Updated `capstone/settings.py` for local development:

```python
# NEW settings (for local development):
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False  # Now works over HTTP
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False  # Now works over HTTP
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
    'http://localhost:8000',
    'http://127.0.0.1:8000',
    'http://192.168.137.1:8000',  # Your phone IP
    'http://192.168.*.*:8000',  # All local IPs
]
```

**Result**: Phone can now submit forms! ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Try It Again NOW!

### 1. Restart Server (Important!)

```powershell
# Stop server if running (Ctrl + C)

# Start server again (settings need to reload)
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Must restart for changes to take effect!**

### 2. On Your Phone

```
1. Open browser (or refresh if already open)

2. Go to:
   http://192.168.137.1:8000/supplier/login/

3. Login:
   Username: test_supplier
   Password: supplier123

4. ‚úÖ Should work now - no CSRF error!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è For Production Later

When you deploy to production with HTTPS:

```python
# Change these back in settings.py:
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True  # For production HTTPS
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True  # For production HTTPS
```

**But for now (local testing), keep them as False!**
