BIT Sys (Bakery Inventory Tracking System) - Ordered Implementation Checklist

0. Foundation
0.1 Configure settings: timezone Asia/Manila, email backend, LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL, STATIC settings
0.2 Create base roles/permissions (Super Admin, Admin, Staff) and seed a Super Admin
0.3 Global UI shell: navbar, messages, auth guards

1. Inventory Masters
1.1 Item master (ingredients/products): code, name, category, unit, reorder_level, min_order_qty, is_perishable, shelf_life_days
1.2 Supplier master: name, contact, address
1.3 Units and conversions (kg<->g, L<->mL) - optional v1.1

2. Stock Lots and Movements
2.1 StockLot model: item, lot_no, qty, unit, received_at, expires_at, unit_cost
2.2 StockMovement model: item, lot(optional), type(receive/consume/produce/adjust), qty, unit, ref_no, reason, notes, created_by, timestamp
2.3 Services: FEFO selector for perishables, FIFO fallback
2.4 Constraints: prevent negative stock (configurable), audit every movement

3. Recipes/BOM and Production
3.1 Recipe model (product, yield_qty, unit) and RecipeItem (ingredient, qty, unit, loss_factor%)
3.2 Produce flow: choose product + quantity -> compute required ingredients -> validate stock -> deduct lots FEFO -> create movement entries -> add produced stock lot
3.3 Costing: moving average cost per item; compute product batch cost from BOM (optional v1.1)

4. Core Workflows (CRUD + Forms + Views)
4.1 Receive stock (purchase/receive): choose supplier, attach lot, qty, expiry, unit cost
4.2 Consume stock (direct use): pick item, qty, reason (maintenance/test) - FEFO
4.3 Produce stock (via recipe): as in 3.2
4.4 Adjust stock: increase/decrease with reason codes (damage, count variance)

5. Alerts and Notifications
5.1 Low-stock thresholds per item: trigger on movement save
5.2 Expiry alerts: lead time configurable (e.g., 7/14 days); nightly job or on-request compute
5.3 UI: dashboard cards + bell list; optional email notifications

6. Reporting
6.1 Stock on hand report (by item, by lot)
6.2 Stock movement report (date range, type, user)
6.3 Low-stock report
6.4 Expiring/expired report
6.5 Consumption and production summaries
6.6 CSV export for all reports

7. Access Control and Security
7.1 Permission matrix enforced server-side for every endpoint
7.2 Bulk permission UI (completed) with Super Admin restrictions
7.3 Input validation/sanitization on all new forms (reuse helpers)
7.4 Session security: password change/reset, lockout policy (basic)

8. Dashboard and UX
8.1 Dashboard KPIs: low-stock count, expiring soon, today's receipts/consumptions/productions, wastage
8.2 Global search & filters, pagination, mobile-friendly forms

9. Data Import/Initiation
9.1 CSV import: items, initial stock lots, suppliers
9.2 Sample seed data for demo

10. Documentation (for study submission)
10.1 ERD + data dictionary
10.2 Use case diagrams/flows (Receive, Produce, Consume, Adjust)
10.3 Permission matrix table
10.4 Test plan with screenshots
10.5 Install/run guide and user manual

- Recommended Build Order: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10
